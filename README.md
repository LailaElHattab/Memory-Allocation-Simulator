# Memory-Allocation-Simulator
A simulator for memory allocation algorithms using python (First fit - Best fit - Worst fit)

### The project is divided into two files; one for the allocation simulator, and the other is for the functions for adding the processes, where:
1. Data is displayed in a tabular style,
2. How much of the block is used and how much is wasted, and
3. The processesâ€™ sizes that will have to wait if no available block is present
